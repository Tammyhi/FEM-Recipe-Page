### I learned

- Collapsing margins include the parent's margins
- .\_. to look at spacing and all other details, not just macro, before writing html and styling
- To use font-face from now on with font files since it's faster than Google Font's importing
- We can change styling of list markers
- More practice with using logical properties for responsive sizing
- Practice with combinators I haven't used before
- Use more intuitive spacing variable names next time
